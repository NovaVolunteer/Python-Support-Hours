The flyer provides details on where and when the support hours take place: "Where: SDS 300, When: Wednesdays, 12-1 PM". It also mentions the purpose of these sessions: "Extra support and practice with Python skills" and provides a contact: "Ali Rivera (ali.rivera@virginia.edu)"](/Sp25_flyer.png)



Welcome to the resource page for the Python Support Hours! This page will be updated regularly with the materials we use.

These Support Hours are intended to loosely follow the topics covered in DS1002, but open to all who would like support in their Python journey.
